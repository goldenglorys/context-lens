# Context Lens: Bringing Clarity to Your ML Training Data

**Why Context Lens?**

If you've ever worked with ML training datasets, you know the struggle: endless lines of JSONL files, buried insights, and the constant feeling that your data is hiding something from you. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with half the pieces missing—frustrating, time-consuming, and often, just plain confusing.

That's why I created **Context Lens**.

**The Challenge**

Visualizing and understanding ML training data, especially for tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), is no small feat. Your data is rich with information, but without the right tools, it can feel like you're peering into a fog, trying to make out the shapes. The raw structure of JSONL files, while efficient for machines, is anything but user-friendly for the humans trying to build, refine, and train models on that data.

**The Solution**

**Context Lens** is the magnifying glass you didn't know you needed. It transforms your nebulous, hard-to-decipher data into a clear, visual interface that’s both intuitive and insightful. With Context Lens, you can finally make sense of your training data:

- **Visualize with Clarity**: No more squinting at dense blocks of text. Context Lens lays out your data in a format that’s easy to explore, allowing you to see the full picture without losing the details.
  
- **Navigate with Ease**: Whether you're diving deep into specific entries or scanning through large datasets, Context Lens provides a seamless browsing experience. Search, filter, and focus on exactly what you need, when you need it.

- **Gain Insights**: Context Lens isn't just about making your data look pretty—it’s about helping you discover the insights buried within. By visualizing the relationships between questions, answers, and images (in the case of VQA), you can spot patterns, identify anomalies, and refine your models with greater precision.

**Why I Built It**

I built **Context Lens** because I was tired of the guesswork. Tired of the endless back-and-forth between raw data and my mental model of what it should look like. I wanted a tool that could bridge the gap—a tool that would let me interact with my data in a way that felt natural and intuitive. And I knew I wasn’t alone.

**Context Lens** is my answer to that challenge. It’s more than just a utility; it’s a way of working with data that puts you in control, giving you the power to see, understand, and act on the information that matters most.

# Usage

Add the data as a `.jsonl` file in the assets directory

```
yarn install

yarn run dev
```

```
open http://localhost:3000
